Projects:

â–ª Nonprofit Transparency Analyzer - AI-Powered IRS Form 990 Visualization Tool
Tech Stack: React, TailwindCSS, Recharts, FastAPI, OpenAI GPT-4, ProPublica IRS 990 API
Built a full-stack web platform that transforms complex IRS Form 990 data into insightful visual dashboards and natural-language summaries using GPT-4.
AI Integration: Engineered dual FastAPI microservices â€” one for ingesting 990 data via the ProPublica API and another to generate financial summaries & answer queries using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4.
Frontend: Developed an interactive React + Tailwind interface with Recharts to visualize multi-year trends (revenue, expenses, assets).
Conversational Analytics: Enabled users to ask financial questions (e.g., "How did expenses change?") with contextual GPT-4 answers grounded in IRS data.
DevOps: Configured seamless local dev setup with uvicorn, npm, and .env API key integration; hot reload enabled for both frontend and backend.
Demo-ready: Supports EIN search, dynamic summaries, and live Q&A â€” with future roadmap for PDF exports and grant-writing assistant features.
Example Use Case: Instantly analyze nonprofit financial health using EIN 20-3568840 to generate GPT-4 summaries and visualizations.

â–ª Swire Coca Cola Capstone Project: Developed a predictive model utilizing historical data to accurately predict the popularity (using Yelp API), longevity, and total 3-year sales volume of new customers for Swire Coca-Cola. Employed a variety of classification models to achieve high accuracy in the predictions. Designed and developed an interactive dashboard to provide stakeholders with real-time access to insights and predictions. Measured the project's success based on the accuracy of the predictions and the effectiveness of the dashboard in supporting decision-making processes.

â–ª Orange Juice Sales Prediction: Constructed a predictive model to predict the probability of customers buying a specific orange juice brand, analyzing the performance of orange juice brands in the grocery store chain using glm (logistics regression) and Xgboost (Gradient Boosted Tree).

â–ª Kaggle House Price Prediction: Predicted house prices using advanced regression models ensemble combining glmnet (Penalized Regression), ranger (Random Forest), and Xgboost (Gradient Boosted Tree). Predicted the final price of each home with 79 explanatory variables describing most aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Project ranked in the top 3% out of 5K teams in the Kaggle with an RMSLE score of 0.12 (~89% accuracy). 

â–ª Super Bowl Game Day Ad Analytics: Analyzed super bowl commercial tweets from Twitter API using R to provide valuable insights to advertisers, including sentiment and return on ad spend. Achieved 3rd place in the Utah game day analytics challenge out of fifty participating teams

â–ª Cricket Data - Web Mining and Visualization: Instrumental in extracting cricket data of players from the cricket database on the web. Created and distributed reports using Scikit-learn to represent each playerâ€™s performance in the form of charts and graphs using Matplotlib library. Technology: Python, BeautifulSoup, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib.

â–ª Medical Data ChatbotMedical Data Chatbot: Instrumental in gathering Lung and Heart Disease dataset, while leveraging to tokenize and separate the keywords from the dataset. Provided strategic recommendations to enhancing keywords and frame sentences.

â–ª Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques: Created and launched a Heart Disease prediction system by using R libraries to enhance accuracy and decrease time needed. Leveraged data mining techniques to assess the severity of heart disease among humans, with a focus on 15 medical parameters for prediction, such as age, sex, blood pressure, and cholesterol level. Technology: R Studio, R 3.4.

â–ª Intelligent Tutor System for English Grammars: Designed Intelligent Tutor System, an interactive web application, to assist middle school students in learning English grammar. Delivered expert technical support and feedback based on assessments and student knowledge. Participated and published a paper in the proceedings of NCCC20 (9th National Conference on Computing and Communication, Mar 6th, 2020). Technology: Python, Flask-Bootstrap.

â–ª Age, Gender and Exhaustion Detector: Developed a system to guess the gender, age, and drowsiness of the person in a webcamâ€™s stream or a picture using Deep Learning. Deteceted drowsiness by Open CV and Adience data set to classify and alert when the userâ€™s eyes are closed for a long period of time. Technology: Python, Open CV, and Keras-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

â–ª Pizza Parlor Application: Created an Android application with user panel, delivery panel, and admin panel for ordering and delivering the pizza. Technology: Android Studio, SQLite, Java.Created an Android application with user panel, delivery panel, and admin panel for ordering and delivering the pizza.
